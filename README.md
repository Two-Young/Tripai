## Reason of Project

Before traveling, during the planning stage, information for flights,
accommodation, meals, and sightseeing must be found within a fixed budget,
which is one of the factors that require more time and effort. In addition,
during the trip, periodic budget management is necessary to prevent the
budget from being exceeded due to unforeseen costs. In particular, in cases
such as overseas travel where cash is often used, there is the inconvenience of
reduced accuracy and speed as manual entries are common in general
household budgeting.\
To solve this problem, we propose a service that provides travel information
suitable for the budget using AI, organizes household accounts easily using
automation technology, and helps with budget management through AI
analysis. Therefore, the purpose of this project is to develop an AI-based travel
assistance service that allows for easy management of travel budgets.
